# Some of the thoughts that I have with repsect to clustering the players
# While the boss hires the players, it is not done randomly 
# It depends on 
# a. The position that the team is missing (Due to an earlier player missing as we see in MoneyBall)
# b. One of the players in the position is not performing well
# c. The need to improve certain areas of the gameplay and so on
# What we have to do is consider every position on the basket ball field different and perform analysis
# Different positions have different requirements. Some need a better 3 point average, some need better assists
# Performing analysis of salaries on the entire basketball players doesn't provide good insights

# lets look at the SG- Shooting Guard position 
# Main objective is to score points 
# They need to have long range shots - 3P should be high 
# They may also assist well 
# SG-SF are known as wingman 
# Good free throw percentage too 
# SG-PG has value too 

# Some of the features to consider for Shooting Guard position conisdering the charactersitcs
# Percentage of games started(Indication of a good player)
# Mintutes played(Generally indicates a good player)
# 3P
# 3PA
# 2P
# 2PA
# FT
# FTA
# AST
# STL
# PTS 
# TOV
# If he played the dual role like SG-SF SG-PG SG-PF
# if he was the MVP of the season 
# the experience that he has (sometimes if he is too aged it might play a role in deciding whether to hire or no)
